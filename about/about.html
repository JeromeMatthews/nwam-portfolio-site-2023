					<p class="body-sect-1__text">
						We believe that there’s a story to be told in everything done. That in business it’s the story behind the product that drives acceptance and following. Nomad believes in telling those stories, in seeking and developing those narratives with clients.
					
						We seek to do this through the use of digital mediums for sharing the story that a client wants to tell, the product they will share with the wider world, or the cause they wish to champion.
					</p>

					<p class="body-sect-1__text">
						Nomad believes in telling those stories. Seeking and developing those narratives. The experience of moving a project from concept  from to fruition. A 
						passion for development in all its aspects, this expands beyond the realm of just business. It’s a predominant thought process we adhere too, a way of
						life that we subscribe too. For us, it’s all about , the in betweenness of getting from A to B and the magic that takes place on the way. We’re all about improvement and growth here, having a kaizen* thought process to our work and lives..
					</p>

					<br />

					<p class="body-sect-1__text">
						<strong>*Kaizen is the practice of continuous improvement.</strong> <br />
						Kaizen was originally introduced to the West by Masaaki Imai in his book

					<h1 class="body-sect-2__head">Where this came from…</h1>

					<p class="body-sect-2__text">
						Growing up I had quite a few interests, I was a widely open-minded child who
						found interests in many topics, I did quite a bit of hobbies that while at
						the time felt mutually exclusive enough, later started to emerge to me as
						more and more connected and integrated. My biggest endeavors always involved
						some discipline, whether purely artistic or physical in nature, there was
						always a deep interest in the creative and iterative processes that
						accompanied practiced study of something. I grew to love observing myself
						rise to creative challenges and developing skill sets in a number of
						creative practices.
					</p>

					<p class="body-sect-2__text">
						I danced, acted, sang, drew, painted, and practiced creative writing along
						with quite a bit of other creative indulgencies. <br />

						Chief among my interests were <strong>technology and media</strong>. I sat trying to figure out what was the defining thing that made me enjoy the practice of so many interests, why would it be so intriguing to start anew on yet another project, or script, or rehearsal for a performance, or to aim to hit a new
						training goal or learn a new acrobatic move or trick and what connected this very visceral feeling I always had in pursuit of them. Something stood out
						to me. It was how in all instances, regardless of the endeavor, a common
						theme occurred.
					</p>

					<p class="body-sect-2__text">
						I loved the process of doing these things as much as I loved to do them
						themselves… The experiences of being able to take an idea about doing
						something, putting it into practice, and then witnessing how those ideas
						grew, morph, and mature always fascinated me. That’s when I knew I
						understood, <strong>It’s about the journey</strong> , about the in-betweens
						of experience.

				<article class="body-sect-3-art">
					<h1 class="body-sect-3__head">I needed to start with why</h1>

					<p class="body-sect-3__text">
						I came across a book that also had a major impact on why I chose to use this
						thought process as the pillar for my company’s statements. “Start with Why”
						by Simon Sinek.
					</p>

					<p class="body-sect-3__text">
						In it he explains how some of the most successful brands of the world came
						to be the way they are and why companies such as Apple and Microsoft can
						dominate cross – industry markets and have such huge impacts on the world.
						These companies know why it is they do what they do, it’s a belief in what
						they come together to produce that permeates throughout those organizations,
						into their products and services and into the physic of their customers.

						
						It explains why people trust companies such as those with a level of loyalty
						that could rival religious fervor in some instances. And for companies that
						do get their Why right, and have it at the fore-front of their business
						share similar successes in whichever industry they find themselves in.
					</p>
					<p class="body-sect-3__text">
						When I read this and begin to understand the concepts, I knew that nomad
						needed to communicate its purpose in the same fashion as well, we seek to
						speak about what moves us to do the things we do. What matters to us and
						what we want to contribute to the world while we’re here.

						<br />
						<br />

						For Apple they want you to “think different”...<br />
						For Microsoft it’s all about: “You’re potential. Our passion." <br />At
						Nomad I would love to: “Tell your story”...
