                    The Nature Tours (Natours) project was completed during 2021 - 2022 over a 5–6-month period where I was searching for a deeper understanding of how the back-end works in a modern web application development stack. I needed to understand by trying to build for myself a basic application that could carry out typical backend tasks while also providing a platform to learn and make use of APIs – (Application Programming Interfaces). Since, up until that point I only had a very broad, elementary sense of the terms and concepts associated with it. Jonas’s course was a brilliant solution to this.

                            Learned how to spin up and maintain a web server to host files and accept I.O. via streams in Node.js. I learned about the inner workings of Node.js and important concepts related to its operation such as Asynchronous coding, the V8 JavaScript runtime engine, and principals for building applications with non-blocking code by taking into account the single-threaded nature of how JavaScript works.
                            This was covered in the first and second parts of the course. Where you’re provided with a deep dive into the fundamentals of working with node.js in two parts:<br/>

                            Parts 1: “Node. JS Basics” – Where you get your hands dirty building a basic node.js server from scratch. <br/> 

                            Part 2: “How Node works” - A high level theoretical explanation of the technology.

                            In the third part of the course the design and build of the API was done. Heavily leveraging the use of the Express framework for node.js. Within which we used a NOSQL database structure with MongoDB as our database and Mongoose as a toolset platformed on top for ease of use in query creation. <br/>
                            
                            Along the way many adjacent and related aspects of app and API development were covered including: network applications, server routing, CRUD operations, data modeling, geospatial data and using the MVC – (Model View Controller) software architecture.

                            Additionally best practices concerning the topics of security, authentication, and authorization were explored and implemented. A mechanism for logging into the application with JSON web tokens were used. Multiple levels of error-handling and User access restrictions were created through the assignment of user roles in the application.

                    JavaScript: Single thread processing and it’s limitations.
                </p>

                    <p class="btl-content-block__text">
                        The single threaded operation of JavaScript and asynchronous coding concepts were a challenge for me to conceptualize for a significant portion of the first half of the course project. Understanding JavaScript’s use of a single thread in CPU processing wasn’t immediately obvious. <br/>
                        
                        I came to get a better grapple on the concept once the theoretical section described the contrasts of how Node.js and the V8 engine works with respect to other pre-processors or languages that use parallel processing or multi-threaded processing, such as Java and PHP. Taking note of the point that JS was developed as a scripting language for the web and later adapted to work with operating systems as seen in node.js. And not essentially having the same demands that would be required of other languages initially intended to handle long running tasks like file uploads which can block other tasks from being carried out if multiple operations cannot be run concurrently in a program.<br/> 
                        
                        Once I started to understand that the asynchronous coding concept was an answer to the limitations the single threaded nature of JS had in trying to work with the operating system i.e.: the file system to prevent blocking processes that would slow down a program. It then started to stick a bit better. 

                
                    </p>


                    <p class="btl-content-block__sub">
                        Using frameworks and tools: Express.js and Postman. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="btl-content-block__text">
                        Once work on the API began in earnest, using express really helped to streamline the development of the features in the API. It allowed for higher levels of abstraction being on top of node.js. An Improvement on the more basic way of creating routes and accessing files as was demonstrated in the first parts of the course. The time saved and ease of the workload on doing things like creating a server, connecting, and management of the routes really became apparent.  Also making the use of an MVC architecture was much easier to create and manage.

                        <strong> The postman app learning curve and working with API endpoints. </strong> <br/>

                        Postman’s interface for testing and developing API’s. Having being my first experience working with APIs it really helped to be exposed to a tool that would aid in troubleshooting issues that came up with testing the route endpoints in a visual way. Postman provided this interface. I had some small difficulty in adjusting to it at first, mainly since working in this context was new to me, not so much on the part of the applications’ UI.

                    CRUD Operations and a deeper understanding of MongoDB and Mongoose.
                </p>

				<p class="btl-content-block__text">
                    Having been exposed to MongoDB and the ideas of NOSQL databases in a prior course I could appreciate the application of using Mongoose as a tool to streamline the use of Mongo as the database for the app. Mongoose simplified the basic Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) operations. Making things just a bit easier while developing the application.

                    A Postman, Atlas, and Compass workflow.
                </p>

				<p class="btl-content-block__text">
                    Once we gain some familiarity with building out CRUD operations on the local server it was time to take those actions and embed them into the API endpoints with the use of Postman and storing the application’s data on MongoDB’s online cloud databasing DBaaS (Database as a Service) MongoDB Atlas. It provided a number of ways to access various clusters to host your data, CLI – Command Line Interface Options and the use of a GUI – Graphical User Interface tool called MongoDB Compass. I used the latter.  <br/>

                    Similar to the experience with Postman there was an initial learning curve to understanding the utility of using MongoDB Atlas and compass. Once the workflow was established it quickly became integral to the overall development of the API and the server-side rendered site. <br/>

                    With all the new frameworks and technologies being introduced throughout the course I at times needed to do my own smaller working examples to help solidify the understanding of what I was learning. The progressive self-study examples I worked on in tandem to the main course project became a small project of its own. One I called data cities, particularly to help with working on the sections central to the development of the API’s core features.

                        APIs present a different model as it concerns security. In a more traditional development architecture, the responsibility of maintaining the “state” or in this case the data to confirm if a user should be able to access the server, is placed on the server. In a stateless system such as an API that responsibility remains on the user/client side in the form of the client’s local storage. One example is cookies on a web browser. This holds true for the idea that APIs can be RESTful - Representational State Transfers APIs. They provide the interfaces to work with their data, but aren’t concerned with maintaining any one state for the data provided.

                            JsonWebTokens seemed a bit complex to get down, while implementation of the encoding wasn’t required in the course as it was already implemented in functions in the code. Understanding the underlying concepts were challenging. A token is made for the user, the user keeps this token throughout the use of the application (being logged in). Whenever the user wants to gain access to a page before their user permissions are checked (assigned to them on the creation of the user at sign up) their JWT needs to be authenticated.<br/> 


                            In the token on the server, it’s unwrapped and examined to see if within it’s signature the required secret can be found. If the secret is found the data payload and its corresponding header are thought to be genuine and the user can be checked to see if they have the permissions to use a particular feature of the application.

                            Creating a website on the server was a first like many others in the course. It required a different perspective from what I was used to, working client side. Inherently more complicated to begin with, setting up a view engine, and using a templating language such as PUG or handlebars did take some getting used to. Particularly working with new concepts like buffered and un buffered code, and interpolation within a templating engine.

                            Heroku learning curve. 

                            In much the same way I found my experience using Heroku somewhat daunting. This project was the first time ever building an application and deploying it to the open web via a cloud service, and as I worked through the last bits of the course, I came to appreciate the complexities involved with pushing an application into production.  A lot was to be done to ready things. Setting up the production environment, doing file clean up by way of removal of in-dev error testing prompts. Preparing GitHub repositories, etc.  It seemed like a project in and of itself. Once I finished following the steps outlined it was satisfying being able to see the actual project live.
